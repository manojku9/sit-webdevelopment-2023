    <h2>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h2>
    </p>
    The character of Iron Man gained even more popularity through the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, where actor Robert Downey Jr. portrayed Tony Stark/Iron Man.
     The MCU showcased Iron Man's origin story and his pivotal role in the formation and subsequent battles of the Avengers.
     Tony Stark's journey in the MCU culminated in "Avengers: Endgame," where he made a significant sacrifice to save the universe.
     <br>

      His story exemplifies the transformative power of individual heroism and the enduring spirit of a flawed but determined hero.

<h2>Powers of iron Man</h2>
</p>
After being critically injured during a battle with the Extremis-enhanced Mallen, Stark injects his nervous system with modified techno-organic virus-like body restructuring machines (the Extremis process). By rewriting his own biology, Stark is able to save his life, gain an enhanced healing factor, and partially merge with the Iron Man armor, superseding the need for bulky, AI-controlled armors in favor of lighter designs, technopathically controlled by his own brain. His enhanced technopathy extends to every piece of technology, limitless and effortlessly due to his ability to interface with communication satellites and wireless connections to increase his "range". Some components of the armor-sheath are now stored in Tony's body, able to be recalled, and extruded from his own skin, at will.

During the "Secret Invasion" storyline the Extremis package is catastrophically shut down by a virus,
 forcing him again to rely on the previous iteration of his armor, and restoring his previous limitations. Furthermore, Osborn's takeover of most of the few remaining Starktech factories, 
 with Ezekiel Stane systematically crippling the others, limits Tony to the use of lesser, older and weaker armors.

After being forced to "wipe out" his brain to prevent Norman Osborn from gaining his information, Tony Stark is forced to have a new arc reactor, of Rand design installed in his chest.
 The process greatly improves his strength, stamina and intellect. The procedure left him with virtually no autonomic functions: 
 as his brain was stripped of every biological function, 
 Tony is forced to rely on a digital backup of his memories (leaving him with severe gaps and lapses in his long-term memory) and 
 on software routine in the arc reactor for basic stimuli reaction, such as blinking and breathing.
 The Bleeding Edge package of armor and physical enhancement is now equal in power, if not a more advanced, version of the old Extremis technology

 <h2>Iron Man Googles</h2>
</p>
The Iron Man helmet is equipped with advanced technology and features, including a heads-up display (HUD) that projects information onto the wearer's field of vision. 
The HUD provides Tony Stark with real-time data such as maps, targeting systems, vital signs, 
and other relevant information to enhance his situational awareness and combat abilities.
It's worth noting that the specifics and capabilities of the Iron Man helmet may vary across different iterations of the character in the comics, movies, and other media adaptations. 
Newer versions or storylines may introduce additional features or enhancements to the technology.
